# S2S2: Semantic Stacking for Robust Semantic Segmentation in Medical Imaging

Official implementation of [AAAI2025] [S2S2: Semantic Stacking for Robust Semantic Segmentation in Medical Imaging](url).

S2S2 is a training pipeline that improves the robustness of a medical image segmentation model.

## Datasets

To obtain the datasets, please refer to the corresponding directory. You will also need to preprocess the data (generate the semantic stack) using ControlNet. Please refere the the [ControlNet](./ControlNet) directory for detail.

## Experiments

To reproduce the experimental results for each base model, please refer to the corresponding directory.
