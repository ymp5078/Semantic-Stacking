Official implementation of [S2S2: Semantic Stacking for Robust Semantic Segmentation in Medical Image](url).

S2S2 is a a training pipeline that improves the robustness of a medical image segmentation model.

# Datasets

To obtain the datasets, please refer to the corresponding directory. You will also need to preprocess the data (generate the semantic stack) using ControlNet. Please refere the the ControlNet directory for detail.

# Experiments

To reproduce the experimental results for each base model, please refer to the corresponding directory.

# License

The project uses code from different repositories. Thus, different licenses are used following the previous work. Please refer the the corresponding director for detail.
